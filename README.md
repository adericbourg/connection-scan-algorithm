Connections scan algorithm
==========================

A Scala implementation based on [Capitaine Train's challenge](https://github.com/capitainetrain/csa-challenge). I'm usong their own data (provided on their Git repository).

For more information abou this algorithm, you ay [read the paper on the Karlsruhe University website](http://i11www.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/extra/publications/dpsw-isftr-13.pdf) (PDF) or the thesis [Delay-Robust Stochastic Routing In Timetable Networks](http://i11www.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/_media/teaching/theses/da-strasser12.pdf) (PDF). Quite hard to read for an humble developper like me, though.
